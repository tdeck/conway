What is this?
-------------
A little ANSI terminal implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in gforth, a dialect of the FORTH programming language.

Why did you write it?
---------------------
I like cellular automata, and I thought this would be a good way to learn a bit of FORTH. 

What is FORTH?
--------------
[FORTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_%28programming_language%29) is a rather unusual stack-based low-level programming language.
